## Think it is a virus?
AltGen is a FOSS (Free and Open Source) software, served as a Chrome Extension, that you can install in your browser. If you think it is a virus, just download it and scan through the code in VS Code, it's all open source. And if you say "no, i'm not downloading it period", your essentially just saying "Oh, I'm going to say this is a virus even though I can look through the code but I don't want to for some unknown reasons", which is extremely stupid. You run thousands of closed-source proprietary code on your Windows/Mac machine every day, all ran by coporations who would add telemetry tracking all without asking in their code, why would I, a developer who codes free code for fun, do that, but a coporation is more trustworthy is able to add all this spyware in your machines, and you think it is OKAY? OK.
